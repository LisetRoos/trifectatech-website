### Automated Demand Response

With the rise of renewable energy resources and ongoing electrification, automated demand response plays a crucial role in optimizing the use of our electricity grid. 

This project is building a modern, open-source Rust implementation of OpenADR 3.0, the latest version of OpenADR, the automated demand response standard that's being developed by the [OpenADR Alliance](https://www.openadr.org/).

Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), our implementation is fast, lightweight, reliable, and can be used in many different environments. It will be an important building block for a multitude of digital products and services required for the further electrification of our energy systems and the energy transition.

### What We've Done

[Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en) started development in June 2024 with initial funding from [ElaadNL](https://elaad.nl/en/), the Knowledge & Innovation center for the joint Dutch grid operators that researches and tests smart and sustainable charging of electric vehicles.

To enable global collaboration and ensure neutral governance, in October 2024 the project became part of the [Linux Energy Foundation OpenLEADR](https://lfenergy.org/projects/openleadr/) project, that was already hosting an OpenADR 2.0b implementation written in Python.

The reponsitory for the OpenADR 3.0 Rust implementation is called [openleadr-rs](https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-rs).

### Current Status

Currently (November 2024) the project is seeing its first external contributions and is almost ready to do a first field-test-ready release, for which we're seeking funding.

### What's Next

After inital funding by ElaadNL and Tweede golf in 2024, the project is currently (November 2204) **seeking a total of EUR 40.000 in funding** for:

**In Dec 2024 / Jan 2025:**
+ Doing a first field-test-ready release 

**During 2025:**
+ Ongoing development and maintenance
+ Continued community building and contributor support
+ Additional releases when new (minor) versions of the OpenADR starndard are published
+ Preparing for a first long term support release
