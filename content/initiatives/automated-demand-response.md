### Automated Demand Response

With the rise of renewable energy resources and ongoing electrification secure smart grid protocols, like Automated Demand Response, play a crucial role in optimizing the use of our electricity grid. 

This project is building a modern, open-source implementation of OpenADR 3.0, the latest version of OpenADR, the automated demand response standard that's being developed by the [OpenADR Alliance](https://www.openadr.org/).

Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), our implementation is fast, lightweight, reliable, and can be used in many different environments. It will be an important building block for a multitude of digital products and services required for the further electrification of our energy systems and the energy transition.

### What We've Done

[Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en) started development in June 2024 with initial funding from [ElaadNL](https://elaad.nl/en/), the Knowledge & Innovation center for the joint Dutch grid operators that researches and tests smart and sustainable charging of electric vehicles.

To enable global collaboration and ensure neutral governance, the project became part of the [Linux Energy Foundation OpenLEADR](https://lfenergy.org/projects/openleadr/) project  in October 2024. OpenLEADR were already hosting an OpenADR 2.0b implementation written in Python.

The repository for the OpenADR 3.0 Rust implementation is called [openleadr-rs](https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-rs) and the project is now often referred to as OpenLEADR 3.0.

### Current Status

As of March 2025, the project is **gaining early traction**, in particular in the Netherlands, and is actively seeking **seeking additional funding** for the items listed below.

### What's Next

As soon as additional funding is secured, we'll deliver an **official field-test-ready release**. This way, (early) adopters can have greater confidence in the project's long-term sustainability.

Our **key priorities for 2025** are:

**Q2 2025:**

+ Official field-test-ready release 

**Q2-Q4 2025:**

+ Support for Dutch DSOs and CPOs who are adopting OpenLEADR 3.0 - **funded**.
+ Bugfixes and maintenance - **funded**.
+ Continued community building and contributor support.
+ Addtional releases to align with new (minor) versions of the OpenADR standard.
+ Preparation for a long-term support (LTS) release.
+ WebSocket-based notification mechanism.

**Additionally** we're eager to:

+ Further contribute to the development of the OpenADR 3.0 specification.
+ Take on a more active role in the OpenADR community.
+ Further invest in community building for the project itself.
