### Automated Demand Response

As renewable energy resources increase, secure smart grid protocols are vital to optimizing our electricity grid. 

Automated Demand Response, ADR, enables utilities and aggregators to manage decentralized energy production. This project implements open-source OpenADR 3.0, the standard the [OpenADR Alliance](https://www.openadr.org/) is developing.

Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), our implementation is fast, reliable, and suitable for many environments. It is a building block for a multitude of digital products and services underpinning the energy transition.

### What We've Done

[Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en) started development in June 2024 with initial funding from [ElaadNL](https://elaad.nl/en/), the Knowledge & Innovation center for the joint Dutch grid operators that researches and tests smart and sustainable charging of electric vehicles.

To enable global collaboration and ensure neutral governance, the project became part of the [Linux Energy Foundation OpenLEADR](https://lfenergy.org/projects/openleadr/) project  in October 2024.

Trifecta Tech Foundation ensures that financial support is allocated responsibly and sustainably.

The repository for the OpenADR 3.0 Rust implementation is called [openleadr-rs](https://github.com/OpenLEADR/openleadr-rs) and the project is now often referred to as OpenLEADR 3.0.

### Current Status

As of March 2025, the project is **gaining early traction**, in particular in the Netherlands, and is actively seeking **seeking additional funding** for the items listed below.

### What's Next

As soon as additional funding is secured, we'll deliver an **official field-test-ready release**. This way, (early) adopters can have greater confidence in the project's long-term sustainability.

Our **key priorities for 2025** are:

**Q2 2025:**

+ Official field-test-ready release 

**Q2-Q4 2025:**

+ Support for Dutch DSOs and CPOs who are adopting OpenLEADR 3.0 - **funded**.
+ Bugfixes and maintenance - **funded**.
+ Continued community building and contributor support.
+ Addtional releases to align with new (minor) versions of the OpenADR standard.
+ Preparation for a long-term support (LTS) release.
+ WebSocket-based notification mechanism.

**Additionally** we're eager to:

+ Further contribute to the development of the OpenADR 3.0 specification.
+ Take on a more active role in the OpenADR community.
+ Further invest in community building for the project itself.
