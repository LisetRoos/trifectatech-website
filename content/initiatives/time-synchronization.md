### Time synchronization

Reliable, securely synchronized time is a building block for the Internet and other critical
infrastructure.

Project Pendulum builds modern implementations of the Network Time Protocol and Precision Time Protocol and creates open services that boost secure time synchronization.

### Project status

Our Network Time Protocol implementation, ntpd-rs, is stable. It is packaged for, for example, Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu and [deployed at Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/2024/06/24/ntpd-rs-deployment).

More on Pendulum's [GitHub](https://github.com/pendulum-project).

### Future work

We currenly seek support for the new project "Secure time for a safe internet". The goals of the project are detailed in [this blog post](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/122/a-safe-internet-requires-secure-time).  
Funding target: € 425.000,-.  

Support us? See [trifecta.org/support](/support).

### History

The initial development of ntpd-rs was started and funded by the [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/) as part of the [Prossimo project](https://www.memorysafety.org/).
