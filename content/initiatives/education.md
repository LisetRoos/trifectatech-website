### A modular university course teaching Rust

Teach-rs, pronounced "teachers", is a university course for computer science students, introducing the Rust Programming Language. 

It is available for anyone who wants to teach Rust. Teach-rs is modular; it enables educators to easily select the tracks and modules they need and build their own custom course material.

### Project status

Teach-rs is ready to use! Universities in Slovakia, Belgium, Romania and the US are among institutions that have used it.

The project has received support from [Rust Edu](https://rust-edu.org/) in the past, and continues to collaborate with Rust Edu to improve and expand the course materials.

### Future work

Work on teach-rs continues:

- New additions to the tracks and modules
- Create and improve tooling to use and contribute to teach-rs 
- Documentation: improving documentation quality and availability
- Visibility: improving the visibility of teach-rs to potential users and contributors

### History

The project was created by Tweede golf in 2022, and was initially called "Rust 101". The early development of the course started in 2022 by Henk Oordt and others at Tweede golf. The project received financial support from Slovak University of Technology (STU) in Bratislava, Slovakia and Rust Edu.

In 2023 the project changed its name to teach-rs, and in 2024 it moved from Tweede golf to Trifecta Tech Foundation, as its long-term home.

A list of contributors and sponsors can be found in the project's [README](https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/teach-rs/blob/main/README.md).
