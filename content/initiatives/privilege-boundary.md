### Sudo-rs

The sudo and su utilities mediate a critical privilege boundary on almost every open-source operating system
that powers the Internet.

Sudo-rs is a sudo alternative that doesn't suffer from memory safety vulnerabilities and is
designed to minimize attack surface.

### Project status

Sudo-rs was [first released](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/sudo-first-stable-release/) on Aug 29, 2023. 

The project is under development to expand platform support and add new features.
