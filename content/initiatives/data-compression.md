### Data compression

Compression algorithms are used in a vast number of protocols and file formats throughout all of computing. Implemented in C, these libraries encounter regular security issues despite receiving extensive industry-wide scrutiny.

Our project plans to create memory-safe implementations of compression libraries bzip2, zlib, xz, and zstd.

### Project status

More soon.

### Future work

We currenly seek support for the new initiative "zlib, xz and zstd: building a data compression ecosystem". Funding target: â‚¬ 395.000,-.

Support us? See [trifecta.org/support](/support).

### Workplan

More soon.
