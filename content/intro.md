Trifecta Tech Foundation is a non-profit creating open infrastructure software in the public interest.

Our trifecta? Safe software / Open Source / Public interest.

*Please note: this is a placeholder website! Although we love synth wave design, we are working on a more appropriate website.*  

**What we do**  
We develop and maintain open-source software and open standards for vital infrastructure in the public interest.

[Pendulum](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/pendulum) is the most prominent project of Trifecta Tech Foundation. The Pendulum project is building modern, open-source implementations of the Network Time Protocol and the Precision Time Protocol.

**Who we are**  
The foundation is governed by the founders and owners of [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl) and functions as the home for their non-profit projects.  
Erik Jonkers (chair), Hugo van de Pol (secretary) and Marlon Baeten (treasurer) are the board of the foundation.
