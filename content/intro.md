# Trifecta Tech Foundation

Trifecta Tech Foundation: Open infrastructure software in the public interest.

**What we do**  
We develop and maintain open-source software and open standards for vital infrastructure in the public interest.

The foundation is governed by the founders and owners of Tweede golf and functions as the home for their non-profit work.
