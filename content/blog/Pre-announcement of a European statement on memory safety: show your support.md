Tara Tarakiyee (Technologist at [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/)) and I, Hugo van de Pol (Director at [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en) and Board member at [Trifecta Tech Foundation](https://trifectatech.org/)), have authored a statement urging EU policy makers to recognisememory safety as a cornerstone of Europe’s cyber resilience
strategy, and to act accordingly. If you feel the same way, please consider stating your support (see below) to help us create an impact. We are now actively looking for organisations and individuals who are willing to sign the statement in support of the call.

The statement is a result of many discussions among both developers and industry stakeholders (to whom we owe many thanks for their contributions), having established a lack of awareness from EU and national policy makers. This contrasts heavily to the high level of awareness for memory safety, and even [the proactive involvement of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign), among others, in the USA from 2023 onwards. In light of the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act in Europe, which mandates a secure-by-design development process, memory safety, if left unaddressed, is now threatening to become a missed opportunity.

## The statement

The full statement can be read [here](/docs/improving-europes-cybersecurity-posture-through-memory-safety-v20251007.pdf). 

The executive summary reads: 

“The number of cybersecurity incidents that affect European citizens and businesses is rising at an alarming rate. 70% of the vulnerabilities in major digital systems built on decades-old technologies share the same root cause and can be prevented by using modern, memory-safe
technology.

This technology is mature, perfectly fits Europe’s forthcoming secure-by-design approach to cybersecurity, and is the most effective way to protect Europe’s cybersecurity, to reduce cybersecurity costs, and to foster innovation.

However, its adoption rate is slow due to a lack of short-term economic incentives. We’ve now left the door wide open: attackers eagerly exploit vulnerabilities in our major digital systems.

The supporting organisations call on European and national policymakers to act, out of obligation as well as untapped opportunity: to provide clear incentives and support for the large-scale adoption of memory-safe technology.”

## How to show support

If you agree with our position that memory safety should be on the EU and national cybersecurity agendas, please consider signing this statement to show your support. You can either sign the statement as an individual or as an organisation.

Indicating your support is easy: send an email to [Hugo van de Pol](hugo@trifectatech.org) (subject: I support the Memory Safety Statement) in which you state your name or the name of the supporting organisation. 

If you know someone who might do the same, please feel free to send them this web page and/or [the PDF of the statement](TODO link).
