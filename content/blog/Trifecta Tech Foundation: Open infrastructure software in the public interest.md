Today, we are proud to announce the Trifecta Tech Foundation. 

The Internet, and our vital systems for water, energy, and communication, require safe software. 

Trifecta Tech Foundation's mission is to contribute to safe and secure software we can all use, by developing and maintaining digital commons, open-source software and open standards for these vital systems.

### Our work

We currently work on and maintain infrastructure software in three areas:

- [Time synchronization](/initiatives/time-synchronization/)
- [Privilege boundary](/initiatives/privilege-boundary/)
- [Data compression](/initiatives/data-compression/)

We are strong supporters of the ecosystem that our projects heavily rely on, the Rust programming language. More on our technology: [trifectatech.org/tech](https://trifectatech.org/tech/).

### About

The Trifecta Tech Foundation was founded in April of 2024 by Erik Jonkers (chair), Hugo van de Pol (secretary) and Marlon Baeten (treasurer) as the long-term home for the open-source infrastructure work originating from [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en).

More about us and our maintainers: [trifectatech.org/about](https://trifectatech.org/about/)

### History

Our work would not have been possible without the effort and support from our maintainers, funders and partners over the last years. 

In particular, we'd like to thank ISRG's [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/) for creating memory-safe NTP and sudo projects, [Ferrous Systems](https://ferrous-systems.com/), the co-maintainer of sudo-rs, and [NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) and [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/) for significantly funding our projects.

### Support us

We need your financial backing to maintain our software and start new projects. Please [get in touch with us](/support) if you are interested in financially supporting us. More: [trifectatech.org/support](https://trifectatech.org/support/)
