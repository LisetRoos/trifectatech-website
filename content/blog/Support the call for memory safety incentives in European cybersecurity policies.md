In light of the upcoming Cyber Resilience Act in Europe, which mandates a secure-by-design development process, we call on organisations and individuals to sign our statement "Improving Europe's cybersecurity posture through memory safety".

<!-- more -->

Input for this statement comes from industry experts at Siemens Mobility, Sovereign Tech Agency, Tweede golf, OpenSSF, the Linux Foundation, the Rust Foundation, and national cybersecurity committees. 

Executive summary: 

> “The number of cybersecurity incidents that affect European citizens and businesses is rising at an alarming rate. 70% of the vulnerabilities in major digital systems built on decades-old technologies share the same root cause and can be prevented by using modern, memory-safe technology.
<br/> <br/>
This technology is mature, perfectly fits Europe’s forthcoming secure-by-design approach to cybersecurity, and is the most effective way to protect Europe’s cybersecurity, to reduce cybersecurity costs, and to foster innovation.
<br/> <br/>
However, its adoption rate is slow due to a lack of short-term economic incentives. We’ve now left the door wide open: attackers eagerly exploit vulnerabilities in our major digital systems.
<br/> <br/>
The supporting organisations call on European and national policymakers to act, out of obligation as well as untapped opportunity: to provide clear incentives and support for the large-scale adoption of memory-safe technology.”

The full statement can be read [here](/docs/improving-europes-cybersecurity-posture-through-memory-safety-v20251008.pdf). 

[Tara Tarakiyee and I](#authors) authored the statement as a result of many discussions with developers and industry stakeholders, having established a lack of awareness from EU and national policy makers. This contrasts heavily to [the proactive involvement of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign), among others, in the USA from 2023 onwards. With the CRA on its way, and the examples of CISA et al at our disposal, now is the time to act.

## How to show support

If you agree with our position that memory safety should be on the EU and national cybersecurity agendas, please consider signing this statement to show your support. You can either sign the statement as an individual or as an organisation.

Indicating your support is easy: **send an email to [Hugo van de Pol](mailto:hugo@trifectatech.org?subject=I%20support%20the%20Memory%20Safety%20Statement) in which you state your name or the name of the supporting organisation.** 

If you know someone who might do the same, please feel free to send them this web page and/or [the PDF of the statement](/docs/improving-europes-cybersecurity-posture-through-memory-safety-v20251008.pdf).
